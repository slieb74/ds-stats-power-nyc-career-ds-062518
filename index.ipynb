    "Power analysis is an important aspect of experimental design. It allows us to determine the sample size required to detect an effect of a given size with a given degree of confidence. Conversely, it allows us to determine the probability of detecting an effect of a given size with a given level of confidence, under sample size constraints. If the probability is unacceptably low, we would be wise to alter or abandon the experiment.\n",

    "* Sample size\n",
    "* Effect size\n",
    "* Significance level = P (Type I error) = probability of finding an effect that is not there\n",
    "* **Power = 1 - P (Type II error)** = probability of finding an effect that is there\n",

We ran a simulation to determine the sample size that would provide a given value of power. In the second simulation, we saw the combined effect of sample size and effect size on the power. We can conclude this lesson with the ideas that a) Statistical power increases as we increase the sample size and b) with a small effect size, we require a large number of samples to achieve required power and vice versa.
